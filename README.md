## Description

    This command lind application prompts the user for information about their team, and displays each member of the team in a neat HTML document. Once information is provided about the manager, the user has the option to add additional employees under two categories: intern & engineer. The user can add as many employees as they want. When the select "DONE", a new index.html file is saved under the /dist folder. Open this to see the output. The viewer of the webpage can click on email links to send a new message to the employee, and they can click on engineer's GitHub name to be directed to their profile. NOTE: all class and subclass tests pass (15 total.... enter npm run test in the command line to see output)
